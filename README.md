note: this application was made in mind to be used for devices with small screens
note: visit http://imgur.com/a/wQx6q to view a set of images showing the usage
note: must be used in wamp/xamp
note: a database is needed with the correct name/tables/columns, .sql file is included for import
HOW TO USE:

go to http://localhost/Resemble.js-master%20FINAL/index.php

go to C:\wamp\www\SEMI\tcas\public\images to select images
drag images to dropzones, it may take several tries but once the Mismatch value shows up it should work properly
first image = emptyLeft or emptyRight
second image = ****Left or ****Right
click GET VALUES


IF USING LEFT side images, click SEND TO DB l
IF USING RIGHT side imgaes, click SEND TO DB r

once done sending images for both left and ride (south bound/north bound) go to

http://localhost/tcas/index.php/areas/index

The result should be there. Do again from the top and click refresh on this page to show an updated image/traffic status
